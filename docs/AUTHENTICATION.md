# Authentication Setup Guide

This project uses Playwright's authentication system to store login states and reuse them across tests, avoiding repeated login steps.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**: Authentication setup projects run first and store login states in `playwright/.auth/`
2. **Test Phase**: Individual tests can use these stored authentication states as needed

## Setup Files

Located in `tests/setup/`:

- `auth-admin.js` - Logs in as admin and saves state
- `auth-provider.js` - Logs in as provider and saves state
- `auth-patient.js` - Logs in as patient and saves state
- `auth-coordinator.js` - Logs in as coordinator and saves state
- `auth-device.js` - Logs in as device and saves state

- `auth-admin-two.js` - Logs in as admin-two and saves state
- `auth-provider-two.js` - Logs in as provider-two and saves state
- `auth-patient-two.js` - Logs in as patient-two and saves state
- `auth-coordinator-two.js` - Logs in as coordinator-two and saves state
- `auth-device-two.js` - Logs in as device-two and saves state

- `auth-provider-admin.js` - Logs in as provider-admin and saves state
- `auth-provider-admin-coordinator.js` - Logs in as provider-admin-coordinator and saves state
- `auth-admin-coordinator.js` - Logs in as admin-coordinator and saves state
- `auth-provider-coordinator.js` - Logs in as provider-coordinator and saves state
- `auth-super-admin.js` - Logs in as super-admin and saves state

## Helper Utilities

Located in `tests/utils/auth-helpers.js`:

- `useRole(ROLES.ADMIN)` - Clean syntax for test.use()
- `createAuthenticatedContext(browser, role)` - Create context with specific role
- `createMultiRoleContexts(browser, roles)` - Create multiple contexts for multi-role tests
- `verifyAuthFiles()` - Verify all auth files exist

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Single Role for Entire Test File

```javascript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { useRole, ROLES } from "../utils/auth-helpers.js";

// All tests in this file will use admin authentication
test.use(useRole(ROLES.ADMIN));

test("admin can access dashboard", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.UAT_URL);
  // Already logged in as admin
});
```

### 2. Different Roles in Different Test Groups

```javascript
test.describe("Admin Tests", () => {
  test.use(useRole(ROLES.ADMIN));

  test("admin functionality", async ({ page }) => {
    // Uses admin auth
  });
});

test.describe("Patient Tests", () => {
  test.use(useRole(ROLES.PATIENT));

  test("patient functionality", async ({ page }) => {
    // Uses patient auth
  });
});
```

### 3. Multiple Roles in Single Test

```javascript
import { createMultiRoleContexts, ROLES } from "../utils/auth-helpers.js";

test("patient and provider interaction", async ({ browser }) => {
  const contexts = await createMultiRoleContexts(browser, [
    ROLES.PATIENT,
    ROLES.PROVIDER,
  ]);

  const patientPage = await contexts[ROLES.PATIENT].newPage();
  const providerPage = await contexts[ROLES.PROVIDER].newPage();

  try {
    // Patient actions
    await patientPage.goto(process.env.UAT_URL);
    // ... patient logic

    // Provider actions
    await providerPage.goto(process.env.UAT_URL);
    // ... provider logic
  } finally {
    await contexts[ROLES.PATIENT].close();
    await contexts[ROLES.PROVIDER].close();
  }
});
```

### 4. Manual Context Creation

```javascript
import { createAuthenticatedContext, ROLES } from "../utils/auth-helpers.js";

test("specific role test", async ({ browser }) => {
  const adminContext = await createAuthenticatedContext(browser, ROLES.ADMIN);
  const page = await adminContext.newPage();

  try {
    await page.goto(process.env.UAT_URL);
    // Test logic here
  } finally {
    await adminContext.close();
  }
});
```

## Available Roles

- `ROLES.ADMIN` - Administrator access
- `ROLES.PROVIDER` - Healthcare provider access
- `ROLES.PATIENT` - Patient access
- `ROLES.COORDINATOR` - Coordinator access

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (setup will run first automatically)
npm run test

# Run only setup (to refresh auth states)
npx playwright test --project=auth-admin,auth-provider,auth-patient,auth-coordinator

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/your-test.spec.js
```

## File Structure

```

playwright/.auth/              # Generated auth files
├── admin.json
├── provider.json
├── patient.json
└── coordinator.json
```

## Configuration

The setup runs automatically before your tests due to the `dependencies` configuration in `playwright.config.js`. The auth files are stored in `playwright/.auth/` and are excluded from version control.

## Troubleshooting

If you get "Authentication file not found" errors:

1. Make sure your `.env` file has the correct credentials
2. Run the setup projects manually: `npx playwright test --project=auth-admin,auth-provider,auth-patient,auth-coordinator`
3. Check that the auth files were created in `playwright/.auth/`
